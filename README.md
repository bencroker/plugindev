## About nystudio107/plugindev

This is a project scaffolding package for Craft 3 CMS plugin development.

## Using nystudio107/plugindev

This project package works exactly the way Pixel & Tonic's [craftcms/craft](https://github.com/craftcms/craft) package works; you create a new project by first creating & installing the project:

    composer create-project nystudio107/plugindev PATH

Make sure that `PATH` is the path to your project, including the name you want for the project, e.g.:

    composer create-project nystudio107/plugindev craft3

## Setting Up Local Dev

You'll need Docker desktop for your platform installed to run the project in local development

* Composer will have already created a `.env` file in the `cms/` directory, based off of the provided `example.env`
  
* Edit the `cms/composer.json` file and change the line `"url": "/Users/andrew/webdev/craft/*",` in `repostories` to point to your local plugin Git repositories
* Edit the `docker-composer.yaml` file and change the line `- /Users/andrew/webdev/craft:/Users/andrew/webdev/craft` to point to your local plugin Git repositories
* Start up the site with `docker-compose up` (the first build will be somewhat lengthy)
* Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to use the site

### Login

The default login is:

**User:** `andrew@nystudio107.com` \
**Password:** `letmein`

### Updating

To update to the latest Composer packages (as constrained by the `cms/composer.json` semvers), do:
```
rm cms/composer.lock
docker-compose up
```

### XDebug with VScode

To use Xdebug with VSCode install the [PHP Debug extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug ) and use the following configuration in your `.vscode/launch.json`:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9003,
            "log": true,
            "externalConsole": false,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/var/www/project/cms": "${workspaceRoot}/cms"
            },
            "ignore": ["**/vendor/**/*.php"]
        }
    ]
}
```
